      <ul>
        <li>Angular Event emitters is one way in which child and parent components can communicate.</li>
        <li>Data flows into a component via property bindings and flows out of the component through event bindings.</li>
        <li>A component can comminicate with its parent by using the Output decorator with EventEmitter to create a custom event.</li>
        <li>Unlike DOM events Angular custom EventEmitters do not bubble.</li>
        <li>EventEmitter are synchronous by default but then can accept a boolean parameter to be asynchronous.</li>
        <li>Because EventEmitters are Subjects ,we can use all the Rx features.</li>
        <li>In parent child component communication property binding is used to send data from parent to child component.</li>
        <li>In parent child component communication custom event binding is used to send data from the child to the parent component.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="mt-3">Usage guidelines:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To create a custom event create an instance of EventEmitter annotated by @Output().<br/>Ex: @Output() statusChanged = new EventEmitter&lt;&#123; id: number, newStatus: string &#125;&gt;();</li>
        <li>The EventEmitter instance calls the emit() method to send data which can be received by event object $event.<br/>Ex (in HTML): (statusChanged)="onStatusChanged($event)"</li>
        <li>The @Output decorator tell angular that the property (the event emitter in this case) is available for parent components.</li>
        <li>The @Output decorator enable outside components to listen to a custom event, which is created using the EventEmitter.</li>
        <li>The @Input and @output decorator are more appropriate for components that have direct child-parent relationship.</li>
        <li>In cases where the distance between the component is greater, it's better to avoid chain of events emitting/receuving and use other methods, such as services.</li>
      </ul>
